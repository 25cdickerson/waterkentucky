# Read Me - waterkentucky
This is the repo for waterkentucky.com | Developed and Improved by Preston Dickerson | Wilderness Trace Solar and Culligan of Danville, Kentucky | Computer Science Intern Summer 22

## Overview
This is a website repo for Culligan Water of Danville Ky. This is a version is not currently running on the domain waterkentucky, but soon will. It is an updated version of the original version that was created in the early 2000s.

My goal was to create a more visually appealing website while still keeping the same great functionality of the old website. I also added mobile support to the website. 

## Working On
I am currently still working on a couple of things:
- Organization of the files
- Adding updated promos
- Create less text heavy web pages
- Update comment code

## For Future Culligan Web Developers
If you have the chance to work on this website after me, you may run into a couple of things. This website was originally built with an Adobe Dreamweaver template which I have since gotten rid of and written my own original code. There might still be a couple of locks on the webpages. If you run into this go to tools > templates > detach from template. 

If you have any questions for me please use the contact information in my profile read me.
